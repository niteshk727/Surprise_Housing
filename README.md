## General Information
- Surprise Housing - A US based housing company entering into Australian market. The company wants to use data analytics to purchase house at price below thier actual price and flip them into a higher price.

- This project helps building a model that the company can use to identify prospective properties to buy to enter the market. We are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
